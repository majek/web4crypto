<pre>
[ ] I'm an application that memorizes strings.
[ ] I have a small hash table implemented here:

hash_table = [[] for i in range({{ N }})]

[ ] I save the string like that:

hash = struct.unpack('I', hashlib.md5(string.encode('ascii')).digest()[:4])[0]
bucket = hash_table[hash % {{ N }}]
if string not in bucket:
    bucket.append( string )

[ ] It's using md5! It's super secure for hash table!

[ ] BTW, I also clean up the hash table once in a while
[ ] to make sure I don't crash due to excesive memory usage!

[+] Your task is to overflow a bucket and DOS me.
