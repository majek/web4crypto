[ ] This is my PRNG code:

def _lcg(state):
    return (1103515245*state + 12345) % (2**31)

def lcg_generator(seed):
    state = seed
    while True:
        state = _lcg(state)
        yield state

with open('/dev/urandom', 'rb') as f:
    seed, = struct.unpack('I', f.read(4))

gen = lcg_generator(seed)

[ ] See - my PRNG is initialized using super secure seed!
[ ] First value of the PRNG is:
{{x0}}

[+] Your task is to predict the second value of my LCG PRNG:
